This repository aims to produce a proof of concept end-to-end methodology which will allow for an optimal choice of technical indicators and strategy to be selected based on ranges of data, whether it be cryptocurrencies or stocks. The fundamental idea behind this is to use robust statistical methods in order to build an optimal strategy based upon the compilation of a singular technical indicator comprised of many other indicators, price information and lagged data. The example utilized throughout this project is trading a range of cryptocurrencies using the Binance API using Minutely Data.
